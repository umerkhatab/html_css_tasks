    <h2>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL 
        INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING
    </h2>

        <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately 
            funded notfor-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi,
            Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities 
            in emerging tech fields like
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cloud Native Computing</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Blockchain</li>
            <li>Internet Of Things</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cloud Native computing: </h2>
        <p>The <b> Cloud Native Computing </b>program prepares the students to program in open source 
            technologies like, <b> <i>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</i></b>
            while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development 
            techniques on cloud platforms like AWS. 
        </p>

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence: </h2>
        <p>The <b> artificial intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the 
            AI technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <b><i> Python, Numpy, Pandas, 
            Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask</i></b>, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and 
            ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice. 
        </p>

        <h2>Blockchain:</h2>
        <p>The main emphasis of <b> Blockchain </b> program is to understand the blockchains like <b><i> Ethereum and 
            Hyperledger (Fabric),</i></b> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on 
            frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed 
            Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of 
            Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of 
            a crypto-token.
        </p>
        <h2>Internet of Things: </h2>
        <p>The <b> Internet of things</b> program introduces the students to open source development technologies
             like <b> <i> Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes </i></b> while
              making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice
               computing for device control. <br><br><br>
